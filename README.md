# Ecological Surveillance Robot (ESR)

The objective of this project is to build a robot for environmental monitoring.
Since the robot will need to move on different kind of terrains, a hexapod seems
to be the most appropriate format for the robot structure. The project will be
developed using cheap hardware and sensors, because we have a limited budget. An
[arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board will control the system and small servo motors will be used to
drive the legs. The mechanical structure will be made of polyethylene, that is
light, cheap but strong enough.
While there are already many hexapod projects available in the internet, our
main goal is to develop a low power consumption one. While many projects use
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and even a whole router, we will focus in using low power
consumption devices.
